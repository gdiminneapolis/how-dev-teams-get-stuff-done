    <h3>What is this about?</h3>
    <p>
        Development teams have a way of working on a project that includes how they plan and proceed through the steps
        on their way to finishing a probject.
        Broadly spoken, this is called the Software Development Lifecycle.
        Through the years, several different styles of developing software as a team have emerged.
        These the the ones we're going to talk about tonight with our esteemed panel.

    </ul>

    <h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
    <p>
        Understanding how software development teams work, especially the software development teams you're a member of,
        will help you to work better with your team, and to better place you in the context of work so you can
        effectively control your work efforts and achieve your goals with the team. It will let you work more
        effectively with the other members of your team, getting you all to your goal faster and hopefully happier.
    </p>

    <h3>Format for the panel</h3>
    <p>
        Each panelist will spend about 15-20 minutes covering their particular software development lifecycle method.
        There will be some overlap, and this is also an interactive discussion, although we'd like to hold off on most
        of the questions until after all the panelists have had their chance to speak.
        Questions for clarification and initial understanding are okay, and encouraged, but questions about "which one is better"
        and the like should be saved for a more rich discussion afterwards.
