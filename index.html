The waterfall model is the traditional model for managing IT
releases. It is associated with large mainframe computer systems.

<li>Implementation: Software is released</li>

</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline4" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline4"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Origination</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-2">
<p>
The waterfall model originates in the manufacturing and was
adopted for software. Each “product” or release tends to be very
large and the timelines very long, over months and years. Bug
fixes are often held for software releases. Sign offs are required
for each stage.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline5" class="outline-3">

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-3">
<p>
It had its place in early IT and the creation of large mainframe
computers.
</p>

<p>
It involves a lot of people from all levels of the organization or
organizations.
</p>

<p>
The documentation that comes out of it can be very robust, albeit
impossible to maintain.
</p>

<p>
It is still used extensively in the maintenance of large mainframe
computers.
</p>

<p>
It forces high level leadership to be aware of the systems key to
their business because of the high level sign offs required.

<h3 id="orgheadline6"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> What's It Not Useful For?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-2-4">
<p>
It is highly inflexible, so there can be many workarounds and
separate databases outside of the mainframe. Supplemental tables
are created in Access and SQL for reporting that cannot come from
the mainframe.
</p>

<p>
Wrong assumptions can be made, because programmers do not
understand the key elements of the business and misconstrue the
intent of the requirement. It is often too late to make changes
when user testing starts.
</p>

<p>
Timelines for enhancements are very slow, and it is difficult to
make comprehensive changes.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
<p>
Incremental development, also known as Incremental Delivery, is
the step between the Waterfall model and Agile development.
</p>

<p>
Incremental keeps the same set of phases seen in the waterfall
lifecycle, but shortens the amount of time spent on each phase
tremendously, and iterates over the steps continuously until
delivery.
</p>

<p>
This was somewhat revolutionary in going from years-long delivery to
mere months-long delivery.
</p>

<p>
Incremental development lacked the planning and tracking elements of
Agile, and various oher aspects that came along later with Extreme
Programming, but it was a huge improvment.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline9" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline9"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> History</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-1">
<p>
According to noted industry consultant Jerry Weinberg, Incremental
development was being used as early as 1957. It was, however, not
widely used or discussed.
</p>

<p>
Larger scale interest began in the 80s and 90s when folks like
Weinberg, Kent Beck, and several others began pushing it as a
solution to the rampant problems with delivering large government
and industry software projects.

<h3 id="orgheadline10"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Where is it Useful?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-3-2">
<p>
Perhaps if an organization wants to go from Waterfall to something
like Agile, Incremental delivery might be seen as an intermediate
step before jumping in, but that has also led to as much failure as
waterfall.

<h3 id="orgheadline11"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Where is it Useful?</h3>

Today, Incremental development by itself is not really something
that is practiced much. It's part-and-parcel of the other
short-term methods that we'll discuss in a minute.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-2">
<p>
Jeff Sutherland and Ken Schwaber conceived the Scrum process in the
early 90’s and it was first tried and refined at Individual, Inc.,
Fidelity Investments, and IDX (now GE Medical).
</p>

<p>
In February 2001, Jeff and Ken were amongst the 17 software
development leaders creating the Manifesto for Agile Software
Development.
</p>

<p>
Following the Agile Manifesto, the Agile Alliance was founded with
Ken Schwaber being its first chairman and he also co-authored the
first book on Scrum with Mike Beedle, Agile Software Development
with Scrum.
</p>

<p>
In 2002, Ken Schwaber founded the Scrum Alliance with Mike Cohn and
Esther Derby. In the years to follow the highly successful Certified
ScrumMaster programs and its derivatives were created and launched.
</p>

<p>
In 2006, Jeff Sutherland created his own company, Scrum.inc, while
continuing to offer and teach the Certified Scrum courses.
</p>

<p>
Ken left the Scrum Alliance in the fall of 2009, and founded
Scrum.org to further improve the quality and effectiveness of Scrum,
mainly through the Professional Scrum series.
</p>

<p>
With the first publication of the Scrum Guide in 2010, and its
incremental updates in 2011 and 2013, Jeff and Ken established the
globally recognized body of knowledge of Scrum.
</p>

<p>
Since its inception, Scrum has been adopted by a vast amount of
software development companies around the world and is today
recognized as the most applied framework for agile software
development with more than 1000 books have been published on Scrum.
</p>

<p>
The method has also been successfully applied in other domains such as
manufacturing, marketing, operations and education.
</p>

If a company says they are Agile or an Agile shop, that means they
use the Scrum process to support the values of Agile and practices.

<h3 id="orgheadline16"><span class="section-number-3">4.3</span> What is it useful for?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-3">
<p>
The definition of Scrum from Scrumguides.org states it is “A
framework within which people can address complex adaptive
problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of
the highest possible value.”
</p>

<p>
Scrum is:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Simple to understand</li>
<li>Transparent</li>
</ul>

<p>
Scrum is an Agile framework consisting of Scrum Teams and their
associated roles, events, artifacts, and rules. Each component
within the framework serves a specific purpose and is essential to
Scrum’s success and usage.
</p>

<p>
The rules of Scrum bind together the events, roles, and artifacts,
governing the relationships and interaction between them.
</p>

<p>
Scrum values:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Commitment</li>
<li>Openness</li>
<li>Focus</li>
<li>Respect</li>
<li>Courage</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="orgheadline17"><span class="section-number-3">4.4</span> What is it not useful for?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-4-4">
<p>
Scrum is simple on the shell, it is difficult to master.
</p>

<p>
Scrum is not magic or a silver bullet.
</p>

<p>
Works best with smaller teams, 5-10 people, who can be completely committed to achieving the Sprint Goal. It doesn’t work well larger groups or with individuals not entirely devoted to the project.
</p>

<p>
You must have both management and team buy-in for Scrum to work.
</p>

<p>
Scrum also doesn't work well if you are unable to define your goals, or break them down into small, quantifiable chunks.

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-1">
<p>
Kanban is an agile process tool that enables project teams to work better. Specifically, Kanban gives teams planning flexibility, faster output, clear focus, and transparency throughout the development cycle.
There are basic rules to Kanban (below) that must be followed if you are to announce that you’re “doing” Kanban. However, these rules are intentionally few, as Kanban is an additive methodology. I.e. the “rules” for your team should grow as your team progresses down their Kanban journey. The team decides together what rules they would like to add to their version of Kanban to best aid the team in meeting its business goals and ensure “their Kanban” fits with the team’s unique working style.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline21" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline21"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> The Rules:</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-2">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Visualize your work</li>
<li>Limit work in progress</li>
<li>Maximize throughput (measure lead time/cycle time)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Inherited from Agile: Your team must agree to pursue incremental, evolutionary change.

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline22" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline22"><span class="section-number-3">5.3</span> Background of Kanban</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-3">
<p>
Kanban started out in the 1940’s by Toyota, as a way to make their
factory floor more productive. However, the idea has been modified
to apply to software development since. Scrum came first, but Corey
Ladas came into the picture in 2009 with his book Scrumban and
suggested that Kanban was a superior alternative to Scrum for
software development. David Anderson completed formulating the
Kanban Method for application to IT and software development in his
2010 book Kanban. Since then many teams that started using Scrum
have switched to Kanban, and even teams that have never done Scrum
have implemented Kanban.
</p>

<p>
Scrum, Kanban, etc are process tools. And as always, you should
always ensure you’re choosing the correct tool for the job. No
process tool is inherently right or wrong. It depends on your
project work and team culture. Read more below to discover what
about Kanban makes it great, and not so great for various project
teams.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-orgheadline23" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgheadline23"><span class="section-number-3">5.4</span> What's It Useful For?</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-5-4">
<p>
Reducing Bottlenecks - Projects where (sometimes hidden/not
transparent to the entire team) bottlenecks slow down work
completion. Visibility of work using the Kanban board forces
bottlenecks to be acknowledged and addressed.
</p>

<p>
Flexibility – Project team is only committing to small amounts of
work at a time, so if the business priority changes or other
external variables shift, future work is able to be reprioritized,
or changed completely.
</p>

<p>
Forcing Timely 100% Completion of Every Task - Teams many times
feel that it is hard for them to bring one task to completion, due
to the demands and distraction of various other tasks. The limit of
the WIP items using the Kanban methodology ensures that another
task does not get started if the project team’s plate is already
full. (WIP limits vary from team to team, but by measuring lead
time, the team can determine which limit maximizes work efficiency)
</p>

<p>
Ensuring High Priority Work Completed First – Teams with a large
backlog of work often feel that feel that more clarity is needed in
what is the highest priority. With the visual Kanban board that the
entire project team and stakeholders can see, priority setting
should be visible to all interested parties, enabling individuals

Encouraging “Swarming” – If the WIP limit has been reached, but
there is someone without work, this forces them to team up with
another team member to get an existing WIP item to completion (this
is called swarming). Swarming is viewed as a positive team working
style that can help communication, knowledge sharing, and
completion of difficult tasks.

Non Self-Motivating Teams – Kanban does not require hard deadlines
for work completion. Team members must self-motivate to move work
across the board.

<p>
Change Promotion/Finalization Limits - Projects where changes are
difficult to deploy to production/be finalized on a regular basis
will have a hard time using Kanban. This is because Kanban requires
you to have the ability to move small items of work into production
in order to pull in new items into the work in progress column. If
your project doesn’t have this capability (i.e. a work item is done
in all but pushing to production, but pushing to production cannot
be done for a certain amount of time), Kanban will prevent you from
picking a new work item… since the item that is not moved to
Production/100% complete cannot move out of the WIP column. (that
being said, there are probably variations that can be made to
Kanban so that it work with teams like these. It just wouldn’t be
100% by the books)

Though Kanban is a newer methodology, this methodology is gaining
popularity at companies large and small. In my experience, many
transition to Kanban after using Scrum, and land somewhere in the
middle regarding what works best for their team. Although, you
definitely do not need to be using Scrum currently to look into
using Kanban for your project team!

two, and ways to transition from Scrum to Kanban.
